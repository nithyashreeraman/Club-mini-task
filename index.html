                <h3>Student learns HTML</h3>
                <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup 
                    language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by 
                    technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage 
                    and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
                     the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

              <p>A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–1.5 kg (2.2–3.3 lb), 
                  while larger ones can weigh up to 7–11 kg (15–24 lb). All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth.

              <p>A puppy's coat color may change as 
                  the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier.

                <h3>CSS Is Apparently a Thing</h3>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
                     presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. 
                     CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript</p>
                <p>
                    Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within
                     the HTML markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes
                      had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML.

                     from their ribs. Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the side-necked turtles.
